# Goal: Design a simple AI Agent with no dependencies!
# This AI will NOT run forever.  It is also safe since it doesn't have API access beyond the OpenAI API.
#
# Usage: Just set your MainObjective, InitialTask, OPENAI_API_KEY at a minimum.
#
# Tips: Feel free to play with the temperature and run over and over for different answers.
#
# Inspired from BabyAGI: https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi
# BabyAGI has many more features and bells and whistles.  But may be hard to understand for beginners.

# Goal configuration
MainObjective = "Become a machine learning expert." # overall objective
InitialTask = "Learn about tensors." # first task to research

# API Key

# Note: As expected, GPT-4 gives much deeper answers.  But turbo is selected here as the default, so as there no cost surprises.
OPENAI_API_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo" # use "gpt-4" or "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Model configuration
